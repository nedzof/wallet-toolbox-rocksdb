/**
 * `TaskCheckNoSends` is a WalletMonitor task that retreives merkle proofs for
 * 'nosend' transactions that MAY have been shared externally.
 *
 * Unlike intentionally processed transactions, 'nosend' transactions are fully valid
 * transactions which have not been processed by the wallet.
 *
 * By default, this task runs once a day to check if any 'nosend' transaction has
 * managed to get mined by some external process.
 *
 * If a proof is obtained and validated, a new ProvenTx record is created and
 * the original ProvenTxReq status is advanced to 'notifying'.
